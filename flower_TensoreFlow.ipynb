        "Our class `FlowerClient` defines how local training/evaluation will be performed and allows Flower to call the local training/evaluation through `fit` and `evaluate`. Each instance of `FlowerClient` represents a *single client* in our federated learning system. Federated learning systems have multiple clients (otherwise, there's not much to federate, is there?), so each client will be represented by its own instance of `FlowerClient`. If we have, for example, three clients in our workload, we'd have three instances of `FlowerClient`. Flower calls `FlowerClient.fit` on the respective instance when the server selects a particular client for training (and `FlowerClient.evaluate` for evaluation).\n",

This means that the server and all 100 clients will live on a single machine and share resources such as CPU, GPU, and memory. Having 100 clients would mean having 100 instances of `FlowerClient` in memory. Doing this on a single machine can quickly exhaust the available memory resources, even if only a subset of these clients participates in a single round of federated learning.\n",

Flower calls `client_fn` whenever it needs an instance of one particular client to call `fit` or `evaluate` (those instances are usually discarded after use). Clients are identified by a client ID, or short `cid`. The `cid` can be used, for example, to load different local data partitions for each client"

There are multiple ways of partitioning a dataset, but in this example we keep things simple. For larger dataset, you might want to pre-partition your dataset before running your Flower experiment and, potentially, store these partition into your files system or a database.
